              <p class="about-p">  What do you want to know about me? If you ask me to use a few words to identify myself with, then I would say an Artist, an Introver and a Creator. I have alwasy been a creative kid. All throughout my childhood and my teens
              I have been reserved and in my own imaginary world. Solving random problems, making random art, reading books and imagining crazy scenarios.  These weird habbits and qwerks translated into my professional life too. </p>
              <p class="about-p">I did my 
              Bachelors degree in technology in the field of Electronics and Communication engineering. All throughout my college years I always took the path least taken, took part in some random events and competitions like electrothon where 
              I had to design and create project in 56 hours and I went at it without sleep for those 56 hours and many others like this. </p>
              <p class="about-p">  Even while choosing my career path I went against the majority of my University. When everyone was going into IT industry I decided to get into electronics and manufacturing. Worked in production lines,
                worked in R and D labs, testing labs and more. I also tried my hands at making art professionally, starting my own business. After trying out different fields and dipping my hand in many things I think I finally found my passion, that is
              combining my creative interests and problem solving skills and interest in technology which led me to a weird combination of Data Analysis and web development. Writing a few lines of code and seeing it turn into these beautiful pages gives me immense satisfaction. </p>
              <p class="about-p">check out the experience and education tabs to see those details to know me better.</p>
